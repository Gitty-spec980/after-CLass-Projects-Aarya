    <h1> Korean Cuisine</h1>
    Korean cuisine is the set of foods and culinary styles which are associated with Korean culture. This cuisine has
    evolved through centuries of social and political change. Originating from ancient agricultural and nomadic traditions
    in Korea and southern Manchuria, Korean cuisine reflects a complex interaction of the natural environment and different
    cultural trends.
    <p>
        Korean cuisine is largely based on rice, vegetables, seafood and (at least in South Korea) meats. Dairy is largely
        absent from the traditional Korean diet. Traditional Korean meals are named for the number of side dishes that accompany steam-cooked short-grain rice. Kimchi is served at nearly every meal. Commonly used ingredients
        include sesame oil, doenjang (fermented bean paste), soy sauce, salt, garlic, ginger, gochugaru (pepper flakes),
        gochujang (fermented red chili paste) and napa cabbage.
