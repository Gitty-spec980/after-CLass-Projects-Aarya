    Hello guys! Welcome to the pizza blog and today we are gonna talk about the marvles of pizza.
</p>
<p>
    Pizza's history begins in Naples, Italy, around the 18th century, where it was considered a simple flatbread dish for
    the poor. Initially, toppings were basic, reflecting affordability. While initially scorned by some, pizza gained
    popularity and eventually became a global phenomenon.
</p>
<p>
    Pizza has a long history. Flatbreads with toppings were consumed by the ancient Egyptians, Romans and Greeks. (The
    latter ate a version with herbs and oil, similar to today’s focaccia.) But the modern birthplace of pizza is
    southwestern Italy's Campania region, home to the city of Naples.
    <p>
    Founded around 600 B.C. as a Greek settlement, Naples in the 1700s and early 1800s was a thriving waterfront city.
    Technically an independent kingdom, it was notorious for its throngs of working poor, or lazzaroni. “The closer you got
    to the bay, the denser their population and much of their living was done outdoors, sometimes in homes that were little
    more than a room,” says Carol Helstosky, author of Pizza: A Global History and associate professor of history at the
    University of Denver.

    These Neapolitans required inexpensive food that could be consumed quickly. Pizza—flatbreads with various toppings,
    eaten for any meal and sold by street vendors or informal restaurants—met this need. “Judgmental Italian authors often
    called their eating habits ‘disgusting,’” Helstosky notes. These early pizzas consumed by Naples’ poor featured the
    tasty garnishes beloved today, such as tomatoes, cheese, oil, anchovies and garlic.
    </p>

    Italy unified in 1861, and King Umberto I and Queen Margherita visited Naples in 1889. Legend has it that the traveling
    pair became bored with their steady diet of French haute cuisine and asked for an assortment of pizzas from the city’s
    Pizzeria Brandi, the successor to Da Pietro pizzeria, founded in 1760. The variety the queen enjoyed most was called
    pizza mozzarella, a pie topped with soft white cheese, red tomatoes and green basil. (Perhaps it was no coincidence that
    her favorite pie featured the colors of the Italian flag.) From then on, the story goes, that particular topping
    combination was dubbed pizza Margherita.
    </p>
    <p>
    Queen Margherita’s blessing could have been the start of an Italy-wide pizza craze. But pizza would remain little known
    in Italy beyond Naples’ borders until the 1940s.
    
    An ocean away, though, immigrants to the United States from Naples were replicating their trusty, crusty pizzas in New
    York and other American cities, including Trenton, New Haven, Boston, Chicago and St. Louis. The Neapolitans were coming
    for factory jobs, as did millions of Europeans in the late 19th and early 20th centuries; they weren’t seeking to make a
    culinary statement. But relatively quickly, the flavors and aromas of pizza began to intrigue non-Neapolitans and
    non-Italians.

    One of the first documented United States pizzerias was G. (for Gennaro) Lombardi’s on Spring Street in Manhattan,
    licensed to sell pizza in 1905. (Prior to that, the dish was homemade or purveyed by unlicensed vendors.) Lombardi’s,
    still in operation today though no longer at its 1905 location, “has the same oven as it did originally,” notes food
    critic John Mariani, author of How Italian Food Conquered the World.

    The passionate relationship between Americans and pizza may have begun with Filippo Milone, an Italian baker who faded
    into obscurity.

    Debates over the finest slice in town can be heated, as any pizza fan knows. But Mariani credited three East Coast
    pizzerias with continuing to churn out pies in the century-old tradition: Totonno’

    As Italian Americans, and their food, migrated from city to suburb, east to west, especially after World War II, pizza’s
    popularity in the United States boomed. No longer seen as an “ethnic” treat, it was increasingly identified as fast, fun
    food. Regional, decidedly non-Neapolitan variations emerged, eventually including California-gourmet pizzas topped with
    anything from barbecued chicken to smoked salmon.
    
    Postwar pizza finally reached Italy and beyond. “Like blue jeans and rock and roll, the rest of the world, including the
    Italians, picked up on pizza just because it was American,” explains Mariani.
    </p>
    Today international outposts of American chains like Domino’s and Pizza Hut thrive in about 60 different countries.
    Reflecting local tastes, global pizza toppings can run the gamut from Gouda cheese in Curaçao to hardboiled eggs in
    Brazil.
